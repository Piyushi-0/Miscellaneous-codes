Python 2.7

Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits,
add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).
The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

    Q : Can the input have 0’s before the most significant digit. Or in other words, is 0 1 2 3 a valid input?

    A : For the purpose of this question, YES
    Q : Can the output have 0’s before the most significant digit? Or in other words, is 0 1 2 4 a valid output?
    A : For the purpose of this question, NO. Even if the input has zeroes before the most significant digit.
